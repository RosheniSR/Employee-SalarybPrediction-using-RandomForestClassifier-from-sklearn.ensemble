# 💼 IBM Salary Prediction Project

This project aims to predict whether an individual's salary exceeds \$50K per year based on demographic and professional features. The dataset is based on the **Adult Income Dataset**, and we use a **Random Forest Classifier** for building a robust predictive model.
